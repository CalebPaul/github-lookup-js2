* Create a website where users may enter a GitHub username into a form, submit it, and see names and descriptions of that person's public repositories.

* Use the GitHub API to retrieve this information. This API allows 5,000 requests per hour with an API key, but only 60 requests per hour without one. Everyone is therefore required to use their own unique key. GitHub refers to these keys as "Personal Access Tokens".


* Does the website work as expected?
* Did you follow all setup instructions, including storing your API key in the variable exports.apiKey?
* DONE Does the app include at least 2 JavaScript files?
* DONE Is exports used successfully in at least one JavaScript file?
* DONE Are dependencies managed with npm and Bower?
* DONE Does the app include a gulp-based asset pipeline with a development server? Does the asset pipeline include all tasks from the homework this week? (See below)
* Are previous standards met?
* DONE Does the project demonstrate concepts covered this week? If prompted, are you able to discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it with an instructor using correct terminology?
* DONE Is the app in a presentable, portfolio-quality state?
